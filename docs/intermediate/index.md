Intermediate Difficulty, the old Advanced Difficulty
====================================================

So, you've made it through the Getting Started section, or somehow stumbled your way here, or both. CCI (proudly) flaunts itself as a flexible, versatile bridge between content creators and their supporters.

To achieve that sort of versatility, many many different features of varying complexities exist. This section aims to cover the more challenging yet more frequently used feature-set that generally takes a bit more effort and time to get set up.

Good luck.
