Defaults&#58; Setting Variables on Load
=======================================

This is an extension of [Event Configuration](../../intermediate/configspecifics/)

Sometimes, maybe because of your [Constants](../../intermediate/constants/) or your [Libraries](../libraries/), you may need to set Variables when the Event Configuration is loaded. That's where the `init` field comes in. Here, you can create Config Events and have the set of Conditions and Outcomes at your disposal.

Set Variables, play sounds, pop toasts, it's up to you, really. Just remember that you normally won't be able to do [Server Outcomes](../../gettingstarted/ccionservers/).
