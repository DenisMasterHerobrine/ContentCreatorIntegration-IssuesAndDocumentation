Finding Your Streamlabs Socket.IO API key
=========================================

| Protip |
|--------|
| Streamlabs usually needs one of their sockets active before they begin transmitting to other third party sockets. I recommend having one of their widgets open during your stream, such as their Event List widget. |

| Protip |
|--------|
| Replaying events through the dashboard works with CCI, but isn't always representative of a live event. Always use live events when making configs where possible. |

1. Go to your Streamlabs dashboard and click on Settings in the left sidebar, under Account

2. In the Account Settings page, click on API Settings

3. In The API Settings page, click on API Tokens

4. And there's your Socket API Token. Copy that, it's what CCI needs.
