Components&#58; The Parts That Make CCI Tick
============================================

This section is allocated to the many different components of CCI: `EventConfiguration`, `Condition`, `Outcome`, `Listener`, etc.

This is more so the "documentation" part of things. Less so "guide", more so "reference". 

Considering I was 3 years and 33 releases late on this, enjoy, I guess?
