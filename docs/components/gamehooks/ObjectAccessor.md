| `function`             | String                                   | The name of the field or method you want to access or call.                                                                                          | Normally will be the SRG name, like `field_12383_a` or `func_83726_d()`. If you input brackets in it, CCI will automatically assume it is a method. If you put `<>`, CCI will assume you want a Constructor. Using a method or constructor with parameters will require [ParamInjectors](../ParamInjector/). Check your log when testing the command, CCI will spit errors there. |
