How To's, a How To
==================

These How To's guides here in hopes that people write guides on how to do a specific something in CCI, to help guide other people on how different things are done.

Feel free to leave credit (to your stream, website, etc) in guides you write. Please be clear and concise on how to set things up, pictures would be helpful. For guides without credit, it's likely I (the mod dev), wrote them.

For others who just want to know how to do things, good luck, and enjoy.
